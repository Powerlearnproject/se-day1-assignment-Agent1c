Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the methods or principles used to design software projects or system development, testing, and maintaining products. its importance: enabled us the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-The First Computer Bug (1947)
    - The first computer bug was discovered in the Harvard Mark II computer, a relay-based computer used for calculations. The bug was an actual moth that got stuck in a relay switch, causing the computer to malfunction. This incident led to the term "debugging."

The Development of the First High-Level Programming Language (1954)
The first high-level programming language, Plankalkül, was developed by German mathematician Konrad Zuse.  High-level languages like Plankalkül, FORTRAN, and COBOL allowed programmers to write code that was closer to human language, making it easier to develop and maintain software.
The Development of the Agile Software Development Methodology (2001)
The Agile Manifesto was signed by a group of software developers, including Kent Beck, Mike Beedle, and Jeff Sutherland.

 Agile emphasizes iterative and incremental development, continuous improvement, and flexibility in response to changing requirements, and it has become a widely adopted approach to software development, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements  —this is where you gather information about the planned application
Design —creating a detailed architectural and user-friendly interface for the applications.
Implementation  —In this process, we start to build our software structure according to the design specifications
Testing  —conducting various tests through the main software, functions based on their serving purposes and requirements
Deployment —the distribution of the software online, to be served or made accessible to the customers or users. 
Maintenance —Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall — follows a linear approach, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one. Requires gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment

Agile — follows an iterative approach, where the project is divided into smaller chunks, and each chunk is completed before moving on to the next one. It works with sprints, planning, development, testing, and deployment phases.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer — Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer —- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager —- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE —-  provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code `(Eg: IDE—VSCode, Atom)`
VCS —- It is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members ` #(e.g., Git, Subversion).`

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight deadlines —-  and pressure to deliver the product/software on time.
Technical Debt —-  Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- We test software to make sure that it functions well and serves its purpose and also to smooth the operation of the software.

- We also test software to make it user-friendly and make it simple to run without frustrating the user 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering —- is the way of sending commands and retrieving data from the internet using AI technology. The better the commands are, the more accurate results you can retrieve through it
AI models help the AI to read and process data fast and accurately.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

My website is not working. I need help with my website.
 An improved prompt: —- I'm experiencing issues with my website's login feature. When I enter my credentials, it shows an error message saying 'Invalid username or password.' Can you help me troubleshoot the problem?

The improved prompt is more effective because it:
Clearly states the problem (login issue)
Error: Specifies the error message
Provides context (username & password)
Asks for a specific solution (troubleshooting)
